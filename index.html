      <h1>02.  <br><span>Who Am I? </span></h1>
      <p class="par">My name is <b>Luke Trlin</b> <br> I was born in 2007, in <b>New Zealand.</b> 
      I went to school in Palmerston North before moving to Tauranga in 2013.
      At my school in Tauranga, we were all given technology to do school work. This sparked my interest in the technology department. 
      Upon starting Secondary School in 2019, I took the <b>Digital Technologies</b> course, which I continued throughout the rest of my school years, yearning to learn more.
      I was interested in programming through various languages and in Year 10, I made my first website.
      It wasn't the greatest, but it was the first time I really programmed something, and the joy I got from planning, creating, and debugging made me want to continue learning.
      After getting my first computer, I spent my free time learning more about various programming languages.
      In Digital Technologies, I created computer programs and digital games using software such as Unity.
      I also took on the challenge of implementing a database into my website, which was a rare accomplishment at my school. I received an excellence grade for this.
      In 2023, I received an Excellence Endorsement for Digital Technologies Level 1, as well as the Contribution to Learning Award.
      In Year 12, I again received the same award. Now, as I move on to Year 13, I continue developing my knowledge in a range of languages.</p>

      <h1>03.  <br><span>My Skills </span></h1>
      <p class="par">Through my years of programming, I have encountered and learned different languages. 
      The first two languages I learned were HTML and CSS, which I now have an intermediate understanding of. 
      Alongside these, I also have a basic understanding of JavaScript and PHP. I am also familiar with Python, using it to create computer programs. 
      The language I am most familiar with is C#, due to my work with Unity. I am also quite familiar with Lua.
      Some extra languages I know (with basic understanding) include Java, C, and C++.</p>
